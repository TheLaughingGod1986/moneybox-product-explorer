# 🚀 Production-Ready Deployment Infrastructure

## 📋 Overview

This PR implements comprehensive production-ready deployment infrastructure for the Moneybox Product Explorer, meeting all requirements from the PRD.json timeline and specifications.

## ✨ What's New

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure
- **Docker Configuration**: Multi-stage builds with security hardening
- **Environment Management**: Staging and production environment configurations
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination and rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack for production monitoring

### 🔒 Security & Performance
- **Security Hardening**: Helmet.js, input validation, CORS configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 req/15min general, 20 req/15min for write operations
- **Bundle Optimization**: 193KB uncompressed (64KB gzipped) - well under 1MB target
- **API Performance**: <2ms average response time (under 200ms target)

### 🚀 Deployment Automation
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime production deployments
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks across all services
- **Automated Scripts**: One-command staging and production deployment
- **Rollback Procedures**: Quick rollback capabilities with backup strategies

### 🧪 Testing & Verification
- **Integration Tests**: 12 comprehensive API integration tests
- **Deployment Verification**: Automated verification script
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time API response time logging
- **Health Checks**: Multi-layer health check system
